<p class="">
The <strong>Internet worm</strong>, also known as <em>Morris worm</em>, was the first program to run and propagate by itself through the internet, taking advantages of bugs and security holes to infect SUN3 and <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr>-derived UNIX systems.

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<h3>Major security issues</h3>
<p>
In order to understand the success of this worm, let's first take a look at the main security flaws and weaknesses it exploited.

<h4>Flaws</h4>
