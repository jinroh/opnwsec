<h1>Internet worm, technical details and aftermath</h1>

<p class="">
The <strong>Internet worm</strong>, also known as <em>Morris worm</em>, was the first program to run and propagate by itself through the internet, taking advantages of bugs and security holes to infect SUN3 and <abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr>-derived UNIX systems.
</p>

<h2>Historical perspective</h2>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<h3>Major security issues</h3>
<p>
In order to understand the success of this worm, let's first take a look at the main security flaws and weaknesses it exploited.
</p>

<h4>Flaws</h4>
<h5>Sendmail</h5>
<p>
The sendmail program is a mailer shipped with BSD systems that supports many transfer protocols such as <abbr title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr>. It is mainly used as a daemon process which permanently listens to the #25 TCP port, in order to retrieve incoming mails by handling requests from remote mailers.
</p>
<p>
Sendmail has a DEBUG flag &ndash; activated by default in the compilation process at the time &ndash; which facilitates maintenance and configuration for system administrators. The dangerous part of the feature is that it allowed someone to send a message to a process rather than a user. Used accurately, with the proper recipient, the worm was able to execute arbitrary code.
</p>
<p>
The underlying issue raised by this attack is the lack of knowledge and skill of most of administrators upon widely-spread tools. It is possible to prevent this flaw by editing configuration files.
